### Hi there, I'm Danilo ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on frontend projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning next js. 
- ï¿½ðŸ¤© Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on project that mix materials science and tech
- âš¡ Fun fact:
I am a material engineer and during 2018 I met technology thanks to some books that I read by AndrÃ©s Oppenheimer, if you are from Latinoamerica you must give yourself an opportunity of reading some books from him. After 1 year (2019) I was interested in the tech realm and I studied a lot.
In fact, technology is the field where you are always going to learn and the most important let you create connections with others around the world ðŸŒŽ

Tech changes life and does a better world!
